Wind powered models

# Aerogenerator Math Model
Computing support to define core values of the aerogenerator design:
- Number blades
- Wind speed
- Power / Blade area 

# Blade Angle of attack manager (blade pitch controller)
The blades pitch angle is automatically controlled depending on wind speed and vectors. The algorithm controls the correct dynamic positioning of the blades. Further work oriented to add a PID controller over the circuit of the pitch servomotors.
