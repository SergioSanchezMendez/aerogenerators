# Aerogenerators
Wind powered models

# Aerogenerator Math Model
Computing support to define core values of the aerogenerator design:
- Number blades
- Wind speed
- Power / Blade area 

# Blade Angle of attack manager (blade pitch controller)
The blades pitch angle is automatically controlled depending on wind speed and vectors. The algorithm controls the correct dynamic positioning of the blades. Further work oriented to add a PID controller over the circuit of the pitch servomotors.

# Real-time app for KWh generation
Allows to manage the electric outcome of the different aerogenerators

# Aerogeneration Open data
RESTful API to provide access to the different values generated by the grid of aerogenerators
